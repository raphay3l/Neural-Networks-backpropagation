# Neural-Networks-backpropagation
This is a custom implementation of a neural network API and its optimization with backpropagation (both stack and online).

The neural_net_api.py includes custom-made API with explanation of the structure within the file.

Neural Network implementation.py implements the forward and backpropagation algorithms.
back_prop and back_online (bottom of the file) implementations use the helper functions to optimize the network given inputs and
desired outputs (all inputs at once and online versions).

Example of implementation is included inside Neural Network implementation.py.
